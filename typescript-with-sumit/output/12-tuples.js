// Tuples : main order 
const tuple = [10, 'Shakil', { p: 10 }];
// Key Points About Tuples:
// - Fixed Length: The number of elements in a tuple is fixed and defined at the time of declaration.
// - Typed Elements: Each element in the tuple has a specific type, and the order of the types matters.
// - Access by Index: You can access tuple elements by their index, just like arrays.
